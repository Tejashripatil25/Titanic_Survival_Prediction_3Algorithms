The RMS Titanic, a luxury steamship, sank in the early hours of April 15, 1912, off the coast of Newfoundland in the North Atlantic after sideswiping an iceberg during its maiden voyage. 

Of the 2,240 passengers and crew on board, more than 1,500 lost their lives in the disaster. 

Titanic has inspired countless books, articles and films (including the 1997 Titanic movie starring Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio), 

and the ship's story has entered the public consciousness as a cautionary tale about the perils of human hubris.
